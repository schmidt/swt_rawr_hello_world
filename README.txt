This project aims to be a basic starting point for SWT development using JRuby
and Rawr. If you want to write Desktop applications in Ruby that can be easily
distributed as Native Binary, you may be interested in this.

In order to create Application bundles (.apps for Mac and .exes for Windows)
you need to have Rawr (1.4.3) installed.


Current status:

It was only tested on OS X 10.6.4. Tests on Windows and Linux need to follow.

A code review should ensure that only best practices of Rawr and SWT in JRuby
are used.
